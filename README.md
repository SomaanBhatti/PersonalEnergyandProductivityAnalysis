# Personal Energy & Productivity Analytics Dashboard
## Project Plan

### üéØ Project Overview
**Goal**: My goal for this project is to that track and analyse my personal energy, mood, and productivity patterns to test hypotheses about procrastination. Everybody knows that procrastination is bad, but to understand personally why it's bad for myself has required me to develop this project to convince myself and my brain, that maybe playing games all day isn't a great thing to do. In order for this project to be completed, I've created the following plan. Data collection begins at 9am on 06 August 2025. I'll be completely honest here, most of the plan was created using Claude AI, but it's not perfect so I've made a few ‚ú®Personal‚ú® touches.

**Time Commitment**: 2 hours/day
**Timeline**: 6-8 weeks
**Target Audience**: Potential employers, friends, and anyone interested in personal productivity insights

## üìä Data Collection Strategy (Google Sheets custom template)

### Hourly Tracking (9am - 12am)
- **Energy Level** (1-10 scale)
- **Mood** (1-10 scale)
- **Procrastination Score** (1-10 scale)
- **Current Activity** (work/study, gaming, creative, reading, exercise, social, rest, procrastinating)
- **Location** (indoors/outdoors, specific room)
- **Productive Tasks Completed** (count)

### Daily Summary Metrics
- **Sleep Quality** (1-10, logged next morning)
- **Weather Data** (auto-pulled via API: temperature, conditions, humidity)
- **Gaming Time** (total hours, which games)
- **Creative/Productive Time** (art/embroidery hours)
- **Procrastinated time**

---

## üî¨ Hypotheses to Test
1. **Primary**: Procrastination negatively impacts mood and energy levels
2. Weather conditions affect energy levels and mood
3. Creative activities boost subsequent productivity, organically
4. Time spent indoors correlates with lower energy
5. Energy patterns follow predictable daily/weekly cycles

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Stack
- **Data Collection**: Google Sheets (mobile-friendly, easy CSV export)
- **Backend**: Python (Pandas, NumPy for data processing, PrettyTable for pretty tables (obviously), sklearn for ML, scipy for statistical analysis tools.)
- **Visualizations**: Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **APIs**: Weather API (OpenWeatherMap or similar) Open-Meteo.com seems like a good one and we can export the result as a csv file.
